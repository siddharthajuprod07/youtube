## Add a new menber
-- Init the sh cluster
splunk init shcluster-config -auth <username>:<password> -mgmt_uri <URI>:<management_port> -replication_port <replication_port> -replication_factor <n> -conf_deploy_fetch_url <URL>:<management_port> -secret <security_key> -shcluster_label <label>

splunk restart 


--On new member 
splunk add shcluster-member -current_member_uri <URI>:<management_port>


--from any other member
splunk add shcluster-member -new_member_uri <URI>:<management_port>

./splunk show shcluster-status -auth admin:monitor!


## remove a member

To run the splunk remove command on the member that you are removing, use this version:
./splunk remove shcluster-member

To run the splunk remove command from another member, use this version:
splunk remove shcluster-member -mgmt_uri <URI>:<management_port>

splunk stop

Remove and disable the member
./splunk remove shcluster-member
./splunk disable shcluster-config
./splunk clean kvstore --cluster

splunk show kvstore-status

## To add a member that was both removed and disabled:

1. Clean the instance to remove any existing configurations that could interfere with the cluster. See "Clean the instance."

splunk stop

splunk clean all

splunk start

2. Initialize the instance. See "Initialize the instance."

splunk init shcluster-config -auth <username>:<password> -mgmt_uri <URI>:<management_port> -replication_port <replication_port> -replication_factor <n> -conf_deploy_fetch_url <URL>:<management_port> -secret <security_key> -shcluster_label <label>

edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/user-seed.conf file as follows.
[user_info]
USERNAME = admin
PASSWORD = <your password>


3. Add the instance to the cluster. "Add the instance."
splunk add shcluster-member -current_member_uri <URI>:<management_port>

## To add a removed member:

1. Clean the instance to remove any existing configurations that could interfere with the cluster. See "Clean the instance."
splunk stop

splunk clean all

splunk start

2. Add the instance to the cluster. "Add the instance."
splunk add shcluster-member -current_member_uri <URI>:<management_port>

## Add a member that left the cluster without being removed from it
A typical reason for a member falling into this category is a temporary failure of the cluster member.

For members that left the cluster without being explicitly removed from it:

1. Start the instance with the splunk start command.

2. Depending on how long the member has been down, you might need to run the splunk resync shcluster-replicated-config command to download the current set of configurations.

./splunk resync shcluster-replicated-config 

./splunk show shcluster-status
