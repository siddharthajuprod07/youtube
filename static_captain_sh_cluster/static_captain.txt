#Shortcomings of the static captain:
1. It becomes a single point of failure for the cluster.

2. The static captain does not check whether enough members are running to meet the replication factor. 

#Switch to a static captain
To switch to a static captain, reconfigure each cluster member to use a static captain:

1. On the member that you want to designate as captain, run this CLI command:

splunk edit shcluster-config -mode captain -captain_uri <URI>:<management_port> -election false

2. On each non-captain member, run this CLI command:

splunk edit shcluster-config -mode member -captain_uri <URI>:<management_port> -election false

#Return single-site cluster to dynamic captain


1. As members come back online, convert them one-by-one to point to the static captain:

splunk edit shcluster-config -election false -mode member -captain_uri <URI>:<management_port> 

2. Once the cluster has regained its majority, convert all members back to dynamic captain use. Convert the current, static captain last. To accomplish this, run this command on each member:

splunk edit shcluster-config -election true -mgmt_uri <URI>:<management_port>

3. Bootstrap one of the members. This member then becomes the first dynamic captain. It is recommended that you bootstrap the member that was previously serving as the static captain.

splunk bootstrap shcluster-captain -servers_list "<URI>:<management_port>,<URI>:<management_port>,..." -auth <username>:<password>
