* Modifies the behavior of KV_MODE when set to auto, and auto_escaped.
* Traditionally, automatically identified fields have leading and trailing
  whitespace removed from their values.
  * Example event: 2014-04-04 10:10:45 myfield=" apples "
    would result in a field called 'myfield' with a value of 'apples'.
* If this value is set to false, then external whitespace then this outer
  space is retained.
  * Example: 2014-04-04 10:10:45 myfield=" apples "
    would result in a field called 'myfield' with a value of ' apples '.
* The trimming logic applies only to space characters, not tabs, or other
  whitespace.
* NOTE: Splunk Web currently has limitations with displaying and
  interactively clicking on  fields that have leading or trailing
  whitespace. Field values with leading or trailing spaces may not look
  distinct in the event viewer, and clicking on a field value will typically
  insert the term into the search string without its embedded spaces.
  * These warts are not specific to this feature.  Any such embedded spaces
    will behave this way.
  * The Splunk search language and included commands will respect the spaces.
